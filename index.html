        <p><strong>A website created while taking Angela Yu's web development bootcamp on Udemy.The primary intent is to learn HTML and it's limitations, but also it's meant to represent what most sites looked like in the mid 90's . It seems there
            are many
            prominent techies and professors who still live in the
            90's to
            this very day<em> well</em> on their personal websites anyway.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Born in late 62 this designer maverick has torn up the scene like no one before or since.
            I have been married 6 times and I know seven is definitely the charm.I üíô Beer and long naps at work-I loves to dance and play in the mud.
            I have a lousy work ethic and a bad attitude but I keep on trucking. 10-4 big buddyüçÅ. Love yourself like you have never loved anyone else. Love thy neighbour and if you don't just remember that Colt, Smith and Wesson, or Winchester
            might live
            there</em></p>
